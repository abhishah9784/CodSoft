# 🎮 Number Guessing Game - Console Edition

## 🚀 Built with C++ Features

This project is built using the following C++ concepts:

- **Classes & Objects** – Encapsulation of game logic using the `GuessNumber` class.
- **Constructor** – Initializes the default number list when the game starts.
- **Arrays** – Stores predefined and custom number options.
- **Control Statements** – `if`, `else if`, and `else` for game decision making.
- **Loops** – `while` loop used for continuous guessing.
- **Switch-Case** – For handling menu choices.
- **User Input & Output** – Handled via `cin` and `cout`.
- **Function Decomposition** – Clean separation of logic into different methods.
