Welcome to **CodSoft** â€” a collection of coding projects by **Abhi Shah**.  
This repository hosts multiple programming projects mainly in C++ (and possibly other languages in the future). Each project is organized into its own folder with complete source code, executables, and documentation.

## How to Run Projects

### For C++ Projects:
- You can either:
  - Compile the source code yourself using any C++ compiler (g++, clang++, etc.).
  - Or download the provided executable (`.exe`) file inside the project folder and run it directly on Windows.

### Example to run Number Guessing Game:
1. Navigate to the folder `Project-1-NumberGuessingGame`.
2. Run `guessGame.exe` directly if you are on Windows.
3. Or compile `main.cpp` using a command like:
```

g++ main.cpp -o guessGame
./guessGame      # on Linux/macOS
guessGame.exe    # on Windows

```
